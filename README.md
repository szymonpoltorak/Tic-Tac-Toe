# Tic-Tac-Toe
Game of Tic-Tac-Toe made to play against computer. I implemented a minimax algorithm to let computer
make always the best move possible. Program made in Java with GUI made using JavaFX. Project is
based on Maven. You can play on different grid sizes starting with 3x3 and ending with 10x10 on automate or manual
mode. You need to have in mind the fact that higher maps will take more for computer to count positions.
